#IFT4055 - Journal

### 02-05-2022
- Learned about MDP and Q-function (see MDP.pdf)
- SMiRL paper up to page 6 (see Smirl.pdf).

Questions I need to answer :
- Auxiliary objective, what is this exactly?
- Minimizing the R.H.S to get maximum reward
- Estimate of state marginal (cannot seem to find reference for that)
- How / how fast can we find the distribution that fits our p_{\theta_t}(s)
- Maximum likelihood estimation : OK. Maximum likelihood state density estimation process???

What I (think) I need to do next :
- More reading/watching on maximum likelihood in machine learning context
- Read paper about DQN algorithm
- Read paper about TRPO algorithm
- Part with Density estimation with learned representations?
